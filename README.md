# Flickr Findr

## Building And Running The Project (Requirements)
* Swift 5.0+
* Xcode 11.2+
* iOS 10.0+

### General Application Frameworks
IQKeyboardManagerSwift: [Keyboard Manager](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager)
RxSwift/RxCocoa: [Reactive Programming](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)

# Getting Started
If this is your first time encountering swift/ios development, please follow [the instructions](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) to setup Xcode and Swift on your Mac. And to setup cocoapods for dependency management, make use of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started)

## Setup Configs
* Open the project by double clicking the `br_flickr.xcworkspace` file
* Locate the `Configs` directory and delete `Development, Production and Staging` file.
* Re-Create the Config files (Staging, Development and Production) and place it in the Cofigs directory. See sample below

`Development.xcconfig`
```
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.debug (development).xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.release (development).xcconfig"

// App Settings
APP_NAME = Flickr Findr (Dev)
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.andela.br-flickr.dev

// Flickr Root URL
FLICKR_ROOT_URL = https:/$()/api.flickr.com/services/rest/

// Flickr API Key
FLICKR_API_KEY = flickr_api_key
```

`Production.xcconfig`
```
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.debug (production).xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.release (production).xcconfig"

// App Settings
APP_NAME = Flickr Findr (Dev)
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.andela.br-flickr.dev

// Flickr Root URL
FLICKR_ROOT_URL = https:/$()/api.flickr.com/services/rest/

// Flickr API Key
FLICKR_API_KEY = flickr_api_key
```

`Staging.xcconfig`
```
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.debug (staging).xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-br_flickr/Pods-br_flickr.release (staging).xcconfig"

// App Settings
APP_NAME = Flickr Findr (Dev)
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.andela.br-flickr.dev

// Flickr Root URL
FLICKR_ROOT_URL = https:/$()/api.flickr.com/services/rest/

// Flickr API Key
FLICKR_API_KEY = flickr_api_key
```

# In your terminal, go to the project root directory. Make sure you have cocoapods setup, then run:
pod install

# Build and or run application by doing:
* Select the build scheme which can be found right after the stop button on the top left of the IDE
* [Command(cmd)] + B - Build app
* [Command(cmd)] + R - Run app

## Architecture
This application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (refered to as MVVM) architecture. The main purpose of the MVVM is to move the data state from the View to the ViewModel.

### Model
In the MVVM design pattern, Model is the same as in MVC pattern. It represents simple data.

### View
View is represented by the UIView or UIViewController objects, accompanied with their .xib and .storyboard files, which should only display prepared data. 

### ViewModel
Only a simple, formatted string that comes from the ViewModel.

ViewModel hides all asynchronous networking code, data preparation code for visual presentation, and code listening for Model changes. All of these are hidden behind a well-defined API modeled to fit this particular View.

One of the benefits of using MVVM is testing.

## Structure

### Extensions
This is to group every component's extension / reusable functions

### Network
This helps with handling `http` requests done by the app and debug reachability as well.

### Model
This helps with data handling, and data parsing.

### UI
This is for grouping views

### Configs
This is for handling configs needed by the app

## Task
* Provide an interface for inputting search terms
* Display 25 results for the given search term, including a thumbnail of the image and the title
* Selecting a thumbnail or title displays the full photo
* Provide a way to return to the search results
* Provide a way to search for another term
* Save prior search terms and present them as quick search options
* Page results (allowing more than the initial 25 to be displayed)
* Use only system frameworks for network requests and parsing
* Testing ðŸ˜ž 

## Solution
* Setup config for project
* Provide a single entry for request handling and caching

## Improvements
* Make image search service more protocol oriented as the view model is.
* Unit test the view model
